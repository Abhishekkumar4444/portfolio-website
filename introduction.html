TML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and web applications. It plays a crucial role in structuring content on the World Wide Web. Here's a brief history of HTML:

Early Foundations (1989-1995):

In 1989, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, proposed the concept of a hypertext system that would later become the World Wide Web.
In 1990, he wrote the first web browser and web server software.
The initial hypertext system used a simple markup language, which was the precursor to HTML. It allowed basic linking of documents.
HTML 1.0 (1995):

The first version of HTML, known as HTML 1.0, was introduced in 1995 by Tim Berners-Lee and his team at CERN.
It had 18 elements, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.
The goal was to structure and display basic text documents.
HTML 2.0 (1995):

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) published HTML 2.0 as a standard, enhancing the language's features and improving compatibility across different platforms.
HTML 3.2 (1997):

This version brought significant improvements, including support for tables, applets, text alignment, and text direction.
HTML 4.0 (1997):

HTML 4.0 was a major step forward and introduced features like scripting, applets, and improved support for internationalization.
XHTML (2000):

XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language) was introduced as a reformulation of HTML 4.0 using XML standards.
XHTML aimed to improve compatibility with other data formats and facilitate interoperability with XML-based languages.
HTML5 (2008-2014):

The development of HTML5 began in 2004 by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of companies
